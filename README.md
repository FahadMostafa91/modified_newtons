# modified_newtons
Modified form of newtons method. It is faster and gives good convergence when we want to minimize a function in multidimension.

A n × 1 function f that evaluates f(x) for a given n × 1 point x; an initial starting point
x0; a positive scalar c with values between 0 and 1; a tolerance value ε > 0; a maximum
limit for the number of iterations given by a natural number kmax
